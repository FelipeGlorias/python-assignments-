#1.) The change that occurs  in increment_int_a does not change a after the function is called
This is because a in this case is an integer, which creates a new object and assigns teh value to a local variable 
#2.)However increment_int_b does change b after the function is called 
This is due to the  fact that b is a dictionary not an integer 
Leading to b being changed immediately 
#3.)In other words integers are immutable, meaning that the local copy of the variable is changed 
Whereas with a dictionary they are mutable, meaning that altering them does change the original value
