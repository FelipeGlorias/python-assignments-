# You would want to use inheritance in place of redundant code 
# Code that you have already written can be inheritaed and used across multiple classes
# For instance defining something once in a parent class give the child classes the same ability 
# Which  is useful for classes that are similar in their function 
# This also lowers the chances of bugs occuring 
# Inheritance also allows you to use code more flexibly 
# Being that if you have a bunch of objects you can use one code across all objects 
# This allows you  to  add new objects  without having to alter existing code
